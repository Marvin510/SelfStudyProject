# Self Study Project - Marvin Miranda Olmedo

1. Do a literature search on what is an effective visualization
2. Select evaluation criteria and put them into a framework
3. Find five visualizations
4. Use your criteria to evaluate the visualizations
5. Write a conclusion

## 1 - What is effective Visualization

Effective visualization is an image that will quickly convey an informative and evoking action message.

The reader has to be captivated immediately and the message has to be unambigous (Pittenturf 2018).

It also has to be fitting, useful and its appearance has to have harmony (McCandless, 2018).

Less is more. Visualizations that tell the whole story with non complex images are more effective ("Seven Elements of Good Data Visualization")
A non effective visualization will be complex, filled with noise and non informative images (McCandless, 2018).


I will assign each image a +1 if effective and -1 if non-effective.

| Effective     | Non-Effective |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| +1            |   -1          | 


## 2 - Evaluation & Framework

Therefore effective visualization takes into consideration the following:

- 1 Informative: Needs to quickly convey an important message
- 2 Captivating: Must catch the reader's attention 
- 3 Simple: Visualization has to fit and can not contain too much noise

-On the other hand Non-effective visualizations will contain the following:

- 1 Unimportant info: Visualization will display redundant or non related information
- 2 Boring: Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action
- 3 Complex: Image that fails to convey information due over saturation

| Effective     | Non-Effective | Points|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Informative   | Unimportant   |       |
| Captivating   | Boring        |       |
| Simple        | Complex       |       |
    


## 3 & 4 - Five Visualizations & Assessment

### Picture 1 ("Climate change evidence: How do we know?", 2019)

This image is captivating. It shows a significant change of current levels of carbond dioxide compare to 400,000 years ago.

It is very easy to interpret.

The comparison of today to years ago is mindblowing and informative.

X and Y axis labels make it super easy to read.This fits the image and gives the story harmony.

The graph is simple and without too much noise and details, it stills conveys the message that climate change is caused by human activity.

| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |   1   |
| Captivating   |   1   |      
| Simple        |   1   |    
| Unimportant   |   0   |
| Boring        |   0   |
| Complex       |   0   |


### Picture 2 ("Effect of Climate Change on Property Claims & Forensic Investigations")

The image is simple.

It conveys the message without redundant information. However, t fails to captivate or grab the reader's attention.

Image fails to evoke emontions or a sense of urgency. It is informative but unimportant visualization for someone trying to evoke change.

| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |   1   |
| Captivating   |   0   |      
| Simple        |   1   |    
| Unimportant   |  -1  |
| Boring        |   0   |
| Complex       |   0   |


### Picture 3 ("3. Are human activities causing climate change?")

![Picture3](https://github.com/Marvin510/SelfStudyProject/blob/master/Images/Picture%203.jpg)

This image is not informative, captivating or simple to understand. 

it is complex as it would require background knowledge to understand the effect of each variable on the image. 

It is just plain data that would cause boredom on the average reader. 

The visualization tries to convey the idea that human's behavior leads to factors impacting climage change. However, the visualization falls short of giving that impresion quickly and therefore is too complex and innefective.

| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |   0   |
| Captivating   |   0   |      
| Simple        |   0   |    
| Unimportant   |  -1   |
| Boring        |  -1   |
| Complex       |  -1   |


### Picture 4 ("Causes of Climate Change", 2016)

Picture has an ambigious message. 

Y axis can be open to many interpretations thus not arousing action from the reader

Does not captivate attention right away. It requires more of the reader to understand colors and proportions.

It is painpul to look at and thus boring.

| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |   1   |
| Captivating   |       |      
| Simple        |   -1  |    
| Unimportant   |       |
| Boring        |   -1  |
| Complex       |       |

-Picuture 5 ("Climate change, what is it? Understanding the basic facts about global warming")

This image argues agains climate change being caused by human activity. They provide a simple graph and make an assertion on the header.

It informs the reader immediately about the author's position.

Image is not captivating and does not evoke actions.

| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |       |
| Captivating   |   -1  |      
| Simple        |       |    
| Unimportant   |       |
| Boring        |   -1  |
| Complex       |       |

### Conclusion

Data Visualization is an important tool to get messages across, evoke action or just to inform readers. 

In this case, I developed a framework to assess images relating to human active causing climate change. My assessment was based on how informative captivating and simple the visualizations were. 

I found that picture one, scored the highest amont all five visualizations. It was a simple graph that compared many years but elegantly highlighted  the recent growth of Carbon Monixide. It captivated my attention and evoke certain ideas quickly.

As stated above, less is more and visualizations that use less complex images, colors and objects tend to be more efficient at getting messages across.
