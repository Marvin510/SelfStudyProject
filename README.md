## 1 - What is effective Visualization

Effective visualization is an image that will quickly convey an informative and evoking action message.

The reader has to be captivated instantly and the message has to be unambigous (Pittenturf 2018).

It also has to be fitting, useful and its appearance has to have harmony (McCandless, 2018).

Less is more. Visualizations that tell the whole story with non complex images are more effective ("Seven Elements of Good Data Visualization")

A non effective visualization will be complex, filled with noise and non informative images (McCandless, 2018).


I will assign each image a +1 if effective and -1 if non-effective.

| Effective     | Non-Effective |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| +1            |   -1          | 


## 2 - Evaluation & Framework

Therefore effective visualization takes into consideration the following:

- 1 Informative: Needs to quickly convey an important message
- 2 Captivating: Must catch the reader's attention 
- 3 Simple: Visualization has to fit and can not contain too much noise

-On the other hand Non-effective visualizations will contain the following:

- 1 Unimportant info: Displays redundant or non related information
- 2 Boring: Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action
- 3 Complex: Image that fails to convey information due over saturation

| Effective     | Non-Effective | Points|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Informative   | Unimportant   |       |
| Captivating   | Boring        |       |
| Simple        | Complex       |       |
    


## 3 & 4 - Five Visualizations & Assessment

### Picture 1 ("Climate change evidence: How do we know?", 2019)

This image is captivating. It shows a significant change of current levels of carbond dioxide compare to 400,000 years ago.

It is very easy to interpret.

The comparison of today to years ago is mindblowing and informative.

X and Y axis labels make it super easy to read. This fits the image and gives the story harmony.

The graph is simple and without too much noise and details, it stills conveys the message that climate change is caused by human activity.

| Criteria      | Description | Points|  
| ------------- | -----:|       -----:|
| Informative   | Needs to quickly convey an important message      |         1   |
| Captivating   | Must catch the reader's attention      |         1   |      
| Simple        | Visualization has to fit and can not contain too much noise      |         1   |  
| Unimportant   | Displays redundant or non related information      |         0   |
| Boring        | Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action      |         0   |
| Complex       | Image that fails to convey information due over saturation      |        0   |


### Picture 2 ("Effect of Climate Change on Property Claims & Forensic Investigations")

The image is simple and conveys the message that human activity leads to climate change.

It conveys the message without redundant information. However, it fails to captivate or grab the reader's attention.

It also fails to evoke emontions or a sense of urgency. 

It is informative but unimportant visualization for someone trying to evoke change or persuade a reader.

| Criteria      | Description |  Points|  
| ------------- | -----:|       -----:|
| Informative   | Needs to quickly convey an important message      |         1   |
| Captivating   | Must catch the reader's attention      |         0   |      
| Simple        | Visualization has to fit and can not contain too much noise      |         1   |  
| Unimportant   | Displays redundant or non related information      |         -1   |
| Boring        | Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action      |         0   |
| Complex       | Image that fails to convey information due over saturation      |        0   |


### Picture 3 ("3. Are human activities causing climate change?")

![Picture3](https://github.com/Marvin510/SelfStudyProject/blob/master/Images/Picture%203.jpg)

This image is informative, but does not have proper labels on X and Y axis.

The bars have two different colors yet there is no legend explaining its meaning.

It is complex as it would require background knowledge to understand the effect of each variable on the image or how they would point to humans activity and climate change. 

It is just plain data that would cause boredom on the average reader. 

The visualization tries to convey the idea that human's behavior leads to factors impacting climage change. However, the visualization falls short of giving that impresion quickly and therefore is too complex and innefective.

| Criteria      | Description |  Points|  
| ------------- | -----:|       -----:|
| Informative   | Needs to quickly convey an important message      |         0   |
| Captivating   | Must catch the reader's attention      |         0   |      
| Simple        | Visualization has to fit and can not contain too much noise      |         0   |  
| Unimportant   | Displays redundant or non related information      |         -1   |
| Boring        | Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action      |        -1   |
| Complex       | Image that fails to convey information due over saturation      |       -1   |


### Picture 4 ("Causes of Climate Change", 2016)

Does not captivate attention right away. It requires more of the reader to understand colors and proportions.

Y axis can be open to many interpretations. A change of 1 or .5 is meaningless to a reader that does not understand the impact of temperature.  The proportion change in temperature is not defined properly.

After some effort, a reader will be able understand that human factors are casusing global changes and this is an informative message. However, it does not captivate or evoke action from the reader.

| Criteria      | Description |  Points|

| Informative   | Needs to quickly convey an important message      |         1   |
| Captivating   | Must catch the reader's attention      |         0   |      
| Simple        | Visualization has to fit and can not contain too much noise      |         0   |  
| Unimportant   | Displays redundant or non related information      |         0   |
| Boring        | Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action      |        -1   |
| Complex       | Image that fails to convey information due over saturation      |       0   |

### Picuture 5 ("Climate change, what is it? Understanding the basic facts about global warming")

This image argues against climate change being caused by human activity. A simple graph is provided and a clear assertion is made on the header.

It informs the reader immediately about the author's position, but does not give striking support for the assertion.

Image is not captivating and does not evoke actions.

It also has some non related information such as time references of when Vikings arrived in Greenland or the Medieval warm period. An average reader would not be able to put a mental timeframe based on these references.

This visualization makes a bold assertion but fails to put information in a simple and captivating format.

| Criteria      | Description |  Points|

| Captivating   | Must catch the reader's attention      |         0   |

| Boring        | Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action      |        -1   |
| Complex       | Image that fails to convey information due over saturation      |       0   |

## 5 - Conclusion

Data Visualization is an important tool to get messages across, evoke action or just to inform readers. 

In this case, I developed a framework to assess images relating to human activity causing climate change. My assessment was based on how informative, captivating and simple the visualizations were. 

I found that picture one, scored the highest amont all five visualizations. It was a simple graph that compared many years but elegantly highlighted  the recent growth of Carbon Monixide. It captivated my attention and evoked certain ideas quickly.

As stated above, less is more and visualizations that use less complex images, colors and objects tend to be more efficient at getting messages across.
