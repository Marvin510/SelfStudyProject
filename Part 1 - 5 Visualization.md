# Self Study Project 

1. Do a literature search on what is an effective visualization
2. Select evaluation criteria and put them into a framework
3. Find five visualizations
4. Use your criteria to evaluate the visualizations
5. Write a conclusion

### Evaluation Framework
Effective visualization is an image that will quickly convey an informative and evoking action message. The reader has to be
captivated immediately and the message has to be unambigous (Pittenturf 2018).

A non effective visualization will be complex, filled with noise and non informative.


| Effective     | Non-Effective |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| +1            |   -1          | 



| Effective     | Non-Effective | Points|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Informative   | Uninportant   |       |
| Captivating   | Boring        |       |
| Simple        | Complex       |       |



| Effective     | Non-Effective | Points  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Informative   | Uninportant   |  |
| Captivating   | Boring        |   $12 |
| Simple        | Complex       |    $1 |
