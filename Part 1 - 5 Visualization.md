# Self Study Project 

1. Do a literature search on what is an effective visualization
2. Select evaluation criteria and put them into a framework
3. Find five visualizations
4. Use your criteria to evaluate the visualizations
5. Write a conclusion

### 1 - What is effective Visualization

Effective visualization is an image that will quickly convey an informative and evoking action message. The reader has to be
captivated immediately and the message has to be unambigous (Pittenturf 2018).

It also has to be fitting, useful and its appearance has to have harmony (McCandless, 2018).

Less is more. Visualizations that tell the whole story with non complex images are more effective (McCandless, D. (2018, July 17)

A non effective visualization will be complex, filled with noise and non informative images (McCandless, 2018).


I will assign each image a +1 if effective and -1 if non-effective.

| Effective     | Non-Effective |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| +1            |   -1          | 


### 2 - Evaluation & Framework
Therefore effective visualization takes into consideration the following:

- 1 Informative: Needs to quickly convey an important message
- 2 Captivating: Must catch the reader's attention 
- 3 Simple: Visualization has to fit and can not contain too much noise

-On the other hand Non-effective visualizations will contain the following:

- 1 Unimportant info: Visualization will display redundant or non related information
- 2 Boring: Does not captivate the reader or fails to evoke action
- 3 Complex: Image that fails to convey information due over saturation

| Effective     | Non-Effective | Points|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Informative   | Unimportant   |       |
| Captivating   | Boring        |       |
| Simple        | Complex       |       |



### 3 & 4 - Five Visualizations - Assessment

-Picture 1

This image is captivating. It shows a significant change of current levels of carbond dioxide compare to 400,000 years ago. 
It is very easy to interpret, the comparison of years and x and y axis labels make it super easy to read. The graph is simple without too much noise and details it stills conveys the message that carbon dioxide is proof of climate change.

| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |   1   |
| Captivating   |   1   |      
| Simple        |   1   |    
| Unimportant   |   0   |
| Boring        |   0   |
| Complex       |   0   |

-Picture 2 (n.d)

The image is simple to read and its message would be informative to the audience. The message is clear that human's activity casue  climage change. However, it is not captivating. IT fails to evoke emontions or a sense of urgency. It would be an informative but unimportant visualization for someone trying to evoke change.

| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |   1   |
| Captivating   |   0   |      
| Simple        |   1   |    
| Unimportant   |   -1  |
| Boring        |   0   |
| Complex       |   0   |

This image is not informative, captivating or simple to understand. On the other hand, it is complex as it would require background knowledge to unders the effect of each variable on the image. It is just plain data that would cause boredom on the average reader. The visualization tries to convey the effect of humans to climate change but fails to do so and therefore the visuals are unimportant
| Criteria      | Points|
| ------------- | -----:|
| Informative   |   0   |
| Captivating   |   0   |      
| Simple        |   0   |    
| Unimportant   |  -1   |
| Boring        |  -1   |
| Complex       |  -1   |
